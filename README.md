# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-with-Genetic-Algorithm
- This is my "Introduction to AI" course project.
- Teacher of Course is Ali Hakan ISIK.
- I tried to solve TSP with my style Genetic Algorithm

## Summary
This problem is about a smart cleaner robot. You can select points to clean from this program and robot will generate a path to clean all of points that you have choosed.
I used genetic algorithm for it but changed it little bit.

Thanks Ali Hakan ISIK for his helps.
